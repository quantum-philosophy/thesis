In this paper we have proposed an efficient and accurate technique to calculate
the SSDTP of an embedded multiprocessor system. Using the proposed approach, we
conducted a temperature-aware reliability optimization based on the thermal
cycling failure mechanism and have shown that taking into consideration the
temperature variations within a multicore platform can significantly prolong its
lifetime without affecting its energy efficiency. The improvement, compared
using the state of the art, is significant.
